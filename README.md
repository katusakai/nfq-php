# nfq-php
This is homework for NFQ PHP lesson 1.

Once we call function:
Nfq\Akademija\Soft\calculateHomeWorkSum(3, 2.2, ‘1’);
It returns integer 6, because all function arguments are made to integers. 3+2+1 = 6.

Once we call function:
Nfq\Akademija\Strict\calculateHomeWorkSum(3, 2.2, ‘1’);
It also returns integer 6, because all function arguments are made to integers. 3+2+1 = 6.
